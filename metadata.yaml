description: 'A storyteller''s night without one of Mr. Andrew Lang''s books of fairy
  tales would be but a dull affair. This one is " The Crimson Fairy Book ", made up
  of some three dozen tales chosen, as in previous collections, from the folk-lore
  of all nations, and adapted and translated mainly by Mrs. Lang. Mr. H. J. Ford''s
  illustrations, colored and otherwise, are hardly equalled in artistic quality by
  those in any other children''s book. This book is fully illustrated and annotated
  with a rare extensive biographical sketch of the author, Andrew Lang, written by
  Sir Edmund Gosse, CB, a contemporary poet and writer. Contents: Preface Lovely Ilonka
